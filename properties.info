; Convergence criteria
convergence
{
	cluster 0.001	; Percentage of total pixels. The algorithm terminates when
					; the amount of pixels that have changed clusters within
					; one iteration is less than this number times the total
					; amount of pixels.
	overall 0.001	; Percentage of the total energy. The algorithm terminates
					; when the change of energy since the last iteration is
					; lower than this number times the current energy.
