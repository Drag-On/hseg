; Parameters of the clustering process
clustering
{
	numClusters 200 ; Amount of clusters to generate
}

; Weights of the different parts of the energy function
weights
{
	unary 5.				; Weight of the unary term
	pairwise 500.			; Weight of the pairwise term
	pairwiseSigmaSq 0.05	; Mean of the bell curve inside of the pairwise
	spGamma 80.				; Mixing coefficient of the clustering term
	spatial 0.7				; Weight of the spatial part of the features
	; color 0.3				; Weight of the color part of the features.
							; Per default it is computed as 1 - spatial.
}

; Convergence criteria
convergence
{
	cluster 0.001	; Percentage of total pixels. The algorithm terminates when
					; the amount of pixels that have changed clusters within
					; one iteration is less than this number times the total
					; amount of pixels.
	overall 0.001	; Percentage of the total energy. The algorithm terminates
					; when the change of energy since the last iteration is
					; lower than this number times the current energy.
